            Oh-ooh-whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
            You know you love me (yo), I know you care (uh-huh)
            Just shout whenever (yo), and I'll be there (uh-huh)
            You are my love (yo), you are my heart (uh-huh)
            And we will never, ever, ever be apart (yo, uh-huh)
            Are we an item? (Yo) girl, quit playin' (uh-huh)
            "We're just friends" (yo), what are you sayin'? (Uh-huh)
            Said, "There's another" (yo), and looked right in my eyes (uh-huh)
            My first love broke my heart for the first time, and I was like (yo, uh-huh)
            "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
            Like, "Baby, baby, baby, no"
            Like, "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
            I thought you'd always be mine, mine
            "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
            Like, "Baby, baby, baby, no"
            Like, "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
            I thought you'd always be mine, mine
            Oh, for you, I would've done whatever (uh-huh)

            And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream (yo, uh-huh)
            I'm goin' down (oh), down, down, down (uh-huh)
            And I just can't believe, my first love won't be around, and I'm like
            "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
            Like, "Baby, baby, baby, no"
            Like, "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
            I thought you'd always be mine, mine
            "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
            Like, "Baby, baby, baby, no"
            Like, "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
            I thought you'd always be mine, mine (Luda!)
            When I was 13, I had my first love
            There was nobody that compared to my baby
            And nobody came between us, nor could ever come above
            She had me goin' crazy
            Oh, I was starstruck
            She woke me up daily
            Don't need no Starbucks (woo)
            She made my heart pound
            And skip a beat when I see her in the street and
            At school on the playground
            But I really wanna see her on the weekend
            She knows she got me dazin'
            'Cause she was so amazin'
            And now, my heart is breakin'
            But I just keep on sayin'
            "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
            Like, "Baby, baby, baby, no"
            Like, "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
            I thought you'd always be mine, mine
            "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
            Like, "Baby, baby, baby, no"
            Like, "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
            I thought you'd always be mine, mine
            I'm gone (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
            Now, I'm all gone (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
            Now, I'm all gone (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
            Now, I'm all gone (gone, gone, gone)
            I'm gone</p>
